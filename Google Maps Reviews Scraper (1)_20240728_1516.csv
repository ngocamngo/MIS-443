When serving the duck to me, our server accidentally poured the juice/sauce into my wine glass, yet he did not apologize nor do anything about it.

The service is excellent, unrushed, attentive and helpful and friendly. The food while simple was perfectly executed. Escargot perfect, roasted half chicken with creamed potatoes and confit of duck leg and roasted potatoes. Ile flottane for dessert just perfect, excellent wine list. And the restaurant is located just across from the seine river.

We arrived at the restaurant after long day walking in Paris, quite tired yet we were very excited to try out delicious food and excellent to end this long day. So the waiter asked me what would we like to drink and I asked if they had any sweet white wine so he suggested Sauternes. It was sweet, better than we thought and my favorite. Sadly, it was the last one and it wasn’t cold, like the waiter said so knowing that, I asked politely to bring a glass with ice in order to drink it as cold as possible and at the same time we ordered food which was: Oeuf (egg, potato and mayonnaise, very delicious by the way), Epaule d’Agneau and Demi Poule. After finishing the Entrée, we were a quarter way of finishing the wine bottle yet the glass with ice haven’t arrived yet so I asked again politely the waiter to please, if I could get the glass of ice. Time went on and we finished the bottle so when we got the waiter’s attention if we could get another bottle of the same wine and he said that was the last one so we asked a champagne. The ice still has not arrived which I asked for the third time to the waiter the glass with ice which he finally did bring the glass of ice with the champagne, even though it was supposed to be for the last wine. When I thought things could not get worse, from the first dish that was served at 19:30 (photo timestamp), we were waiting and waiting, other customers who came 30 mins later ordered and got served, we were still waiting and waiting. I have even asked the waiter where was the food with a sign and he told me to wait. Around 20:30, the food finally came, it had very good looks and excellent presentation but we were done waiting, we lost the appetite and I told the waiter if I could talk to his manager. He did not respond and left. 3 minutes went by and nobody came so I had to get up, find him and ask him politely if I could talk to the manager which he finally told someone to take responsibility of what happened as we just wanted to leave as fast as we could since that was the worst experience I ever had on any restaurant. Finally, the waiter removed the food which we left uneaten and we paid for the two bottles of wine (less than half unfinished champagne), Oeuf (very delicious dish) and two glasses of water.

I expected to get a reduced rate for the service but I did not and I feel very disappointed on how good food can be ruined so badly from the service I got. I am never coming back again.","1","2781","Chen Yang","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115773906133922791905?hl=en","115773906133922791905","26","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXbLigydfTeg9bOiINtFcLx-HSQGG-RBTmm__G2DKR1tKrJqKNo",,"0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:04:06.268215+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

I had reasonably high expectations for the quality of food and service at the Rôtisserie. The menu offered a Ribeye that was so tough the serrated knife could not cut through it. The server opened the best bottle of Champagne on the menu and did not wait to allow the tasting. He also talked me off ordering the duck confit and onto the Veal, which was in a delicious sauce, however, were not veal medallions but veal kidneys. I understand that it is my responsibility to understand the French menu, however, my 16 lessons of French did not render the word, “kidney” into my new French vocabulary.

I had reasonably high expectations for the quality of food and service at the Rôtisserie. The menu offered a Ribeye that was so tough the serrated knife could not cut through it. The server opened the best bottle of Champagne on the menu and did not wait to allow the tasting. He also talked me off ordering the duck confit and onto the Veal, which was in a delicious sauce, however, were not veal medallions but veal kidneys. I understand that it is my responsibility to understand the French menu, however, my 16 lessons of French did not render the word, “kidney” into my new French vocabulary. Most of the chicken dishes were also delicious, and one was dry. My effort to show my party of 8 a great dining experience with the sister Tour d’Argent was a failure.

The various servers and the sommelier were attentive to every detail and made sure we were pleased every step of the way. We felt as if we were valued guests. Yes, it is expensive, but for an experience of a lifetime it was a worthy investment in a lasting memory.","0","2781","Susan M","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103547590220556991654?hl=en","103547590220556991654","9","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ_u8yIy1cHohmQiBXqCP0J6k-t52DtwsoEQhOU7SAlM7xtGA","2024-05-28 00:00:00","0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:04:15.823357+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable—attentive yet never intrusive. The staff orchestrated a seamless dining experience, allowing us to savor every moment in the enchanting ambiance with a breathtaking view of Notre Dame. The wine experience, curated by the exceptionally knowledgeable sommelier, was truly spectacular. We started with a 2007 Puligny-Montrachet Clavoillon, which was deliciously nuanced and set the perfect tone for the evening. However, the true star was the 1989 Gevrey-Chambertin Cazetiers, a legendary wine that surpassed all expectations. Each sip was a revelation, perfectly complementing the exquisite dishes prepared by Chef Yannick. As a professional chef with thirty years of experience, I was thoroughly impressed with the innovative renditions of the classics. The thoughtful preparations, attention to detail, and use of the highest quality ingredients showcased Chef Yannick’s exceptional talent and dedication. Every course was a masterpiece, beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The view of Notre Dame added a magical touch to an already perfect evening. The combination of outstanding service, phenomenal food, and extraordinary wine made for an unforgettable experience. La Tour d'Argent is a place where culinary dreams come true, and I am thrilled to have crossed it off my bucket list.","0","2781","Jeffrey Nimer","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118117929883554137219?hl=en","118117929883554137219","3","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUxzWf62hiTql4bIDlL5lvL_2BkzQPjNWHLxsdcsOUmu9OfJAxv","2024-07-28 00:00:00","0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:04:18.713789+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

We were given the pleasure of comfort and leisure to make for a night we could always remember. We were provided the best table and were so happy to view our last night in Paris overlooking your beautiful city. We had eaten at 3 Michelin restaurants in Paris one of which was Le Meurice. We had been so pleased by the welcoming nature of every place including Tour d’Argent. The waitress was so kind to our daughter and presented each dish excellently. Unfortunately, we quickly lost our experience just following the presentation of the great and extensive wine collection by the Sommelier who had a tattoo of a cross in the back of his neck. We asked for his opinion regarding pairing our wine with our pescatarian selection since it was Friday during Lent. The Sommelier simply told us one white wine we should have for our first and said something under his breath. He did not come back to our table and we were without wine for the next course. After his first presentation, we did not see him again despite him standing at the front talking with the other staff in a full restaurant, and rather the young gentleman who had been serving our water, came to our table to ask us for what we wanted for our next wine. He presented the big book again as if he was a Sommelier. We know a Sommelier is identified by their pin and extensive knowledge even though he presented himself and one. The young gentlemen could not describe any of the wines. We informed him that the Sommelier was supposed to have wine selection for us. The young gentleman proceeded to tell us that he was here to help and we should get red wine for the meat course even though we were suppose to have a fish menu. He brought out the book again but this time showed us the front page and said this is what you have available by the glass. We let him know that we were planning on having fish, but he had said that we were going to have meat and should select a red wine next not a white wine. We were confused at this point, and decided to go with his recommendation for the red wine. However, when our main course was presented, it was the fish selection. Therefore, the red wine, which was very bold, not at all paired with our food selection. In fact, we were very disappointed in how it overrode the delicate preparation of the chefs cuisine. We knew better but decided to take the guidance of your staff. We have dealt with many Sommeliers and have visited Michelin starred restaurants all over the world. We have had only one other experience that was poorly executed by the Sommelier like the one here with the cross on his neck. The shame is that this role in the orchestrating of a great dinner is just as important as the chef preparing the food or the wait staff presenting the cuisine. We highly respect their wine expertise and appreciate their guidance in bringing us the best notes from the wines they often select for us. I prefer their recommendations because they are the experts. Everyone at Tour d’Argent did their part except him and it was further misguided by the waiter who served water and had no idea what our dinner was or the wine selections. The billing did not match our wine selection which was corrected. In the end, I would have expected we would not have paid for the red wine at all considering we informed the staff and the new Sommelier that we were told to select bold reds with the light fish prepared for us.

The early June weather seemed primed for a meal on the terrasse (terrace). This is set up on the northwest corner of Quai de la Tournelle and Pont de la Tournelle, one of the bridges connecting the city to Ile St. Louis. Born out of the pandemic, the outdoor location now seems to be an established extension of the restaurant during good weather. The bridge’s wide sidewalk provides space for two and four top tables. Wooden planter boxes give a sense of separation from the foot and car traffic. The tables next to the bridge railing have an unobstructed view of the Seine, Ile St. Louis, Notre Dame, and, alas, the reconstruction works and equipment. When the sun begins to set, however, the view is enchanting! My friend and I had dinner on the terrace for our first and last restaurant meals in Paris. The first night’s dinner started with a La Rotisserie’s version of the French classic eggs and mayonnaise, followed by perfectly cooked sea bream. Our food was well prepared and delicious, especially the chilled white asparagus and Chartreuse sauce that was the starter for our final dinner. We didn’t know if Chartreuse was an ingredient or referred to the color of the sauce. Regardless, it was so good that we didn’t let a drop go waste and used bread to capture all of it. My friend’s request for a vegetarian main course resulted in a delightful mélange of eggplant and tomatoes accompanied by haricots verts, grilled baby hearts of romaine, and little roasted potatoes. I thoroughly enjoyed my glazed pork belly and shitake mushrooms, as well as the silky carrot ginger puree that complemented them. The service was professional and attentive, and we were astonished with how much work is involved serving dinner on the bridge. The waiters constantly cross Quai de la Tournelle, a busy street that separates the restaurant from the terrace. They must carry everything back and forth: all of the food and drink and trays heavily laden with used dishes, glasses, and silverware. It’s helpful to keep this in mind if it takes a little longer than expected to receive your meal or drinks. Although the outdoor area must close by 10 p.m., those who wish to linger over dessert or a digestif can do so inside the restaurant. I understand that La Rotisserie’s sister restaurant and near neighbor, La Tour D’Argent, offers a notable perspective of the river and Notre Dame from its sixth floor location. However, after my latest visits to La Rotisserie it’s difficult to imagine how seeing that view through a glass window could compare to a picture perfect summer dinner on the bridge.","Google","ChIJg4octORx5kcRijmhQTSm1Fs","La Rôtisserie d'Argent","a year ago","2022-12-03 09:13:07.750206+00","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAhX9lUTPmMJjOkZXOVnIZaU8rhtxVQ7pIfN2_, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWYMFYDE1yPJTI71kxF3jn0dwr4mtjAvTt0iHl, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORriq7UgUigZfWpUz2PydTrdDfijn7S878VcCk","4.4","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQteWJmNExBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID-ybf4LA%7CCgwIkOD5pAYQyKLuuwM%7C?hl=en","","5","Although this was not my first time eating at La Rotisserie D’Argent, it was my first outdoor dining experience there. The early June weather seemed primed for a meal on the terrasse (terrace). This is set up on the northwest corner of Quai de la Tournelle and Pont de la Tournelle, one of the bridges connecting the city to Ile St. Louis. Born out of the pandemic, the outdoor location now seems to be an established extension of the restaurant during good weather. The bridge’s wide sidewalk provides space for two and four top tables. Wooden planter boxes give a sense of separation from the foot and car traffic. The tables next to the bridge railing have an unobstructed view of the Seine, Ile St. Louis, Notre Dame, and, alas, the reconstruction works and equipment.

If you’re French, sitting in la Tour d Argent, you’re feeling like you’re on top of the world… and you are since you have a magnificent view over, what we French consider as the world: Paris and Notre Dame. I know what you’re going to say: it’s expensive. You’re right. It is. Is it really though ? The lunch menu is less than a very average 3 stars hotel in the city center. Which memories will last a lifetime? A meal at La Tour or an hotel night in a very average place? I had the good fortune of speaking with the manager of the group (they also have a bakery -aka “oh my god those croissants are so good”, and an epicerie ). Interestingly, the difference with the others famous star Michelin in Paris, is that the proportion of none Parisian French customers is uniquely higher, allowing them to reopen way before the other big names. It does make sense. I wouldn’t live in Paris, why wouldn’t I eat in a place where I enjoy Paris, a great cuisine and an impeccable service? Still, for the French, we save this restaurant for the “grandes occasions”, exceptional events like engagement, diplomas, etc… well, I’m living 2 mn walk from the place, I feel like I need to more exceptional event in my life… So when I went, the restaurant patrons were mainly French, which is really different from other place I went (see my review on Septime). To make it short, if you want to be amongst wealthy French, now you know the address. Which brings me to another point: the dressing code/mood. You ll receive an email after you booked reminding you that you should dress properly. Well, I think it’s important because I think there are places, where it’s great when all the patrons are well dressed. Being well dressed, it’s not only important for your experience, but also for the others, as you’re participating in creating an unique memory. I would feel as I m not respecting the other patrons (especially the couples) moment by not dressing up. I saw some French guy in chic, yet slightly casual, I was about to call the fashion police on them! One last thing, don’t worry about it being to « formal « , the waiters will know how to put you at ease. It’s the quality of all the good Michelin Stars waiters, nice enough to be at ease, distant enough to feel respected. Here you have la crème de la crème. But what about the food, I hear you wondering. It’s true that the setting, the history and the service will first occupy your mind. But then, you wonder if the cuisine will be up to the same level. The task is incredibly difficult. You went to be classical, yet haute cuisine, with some innovations (but not too much). The chef, who is a “meilleur ouvrier de France “ (like “top chef”, but before, without cameras and really focus on the cuisine…) manages to avoid the traps, and delivers beautifully. He manages to get out alive of this culinary “mine field “. Look at my pictures. It’s as good as it looks. It’s perfectly executed, coherent, balanced and perfectly in line with the rest of the experience. Which is another fit in itself. It’s a very well deserved star, a top tiers one star. It’ll create memories, that’ll you speak about years later. And I need to find a good reason to go back!","Google","ChIJg4octORx5kcRijmhQTSm1Fs","La Rôtisserie d'Argent","2 years ago","2021-09-19 17:57:25.358306+00","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7xOWqOtK7pyW48I1notyIPfXmxe300_qMghQr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdA1yAIAhozMQV1HR6SSAPlyAtAAWvv0fsXNQv, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSk9kWfilDp4-ZbXhPGTC2pZkXyiIE0jjj4SAS, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJgw1gJ7pyO0ojNGuiXh18P3aTENyo6UvgYwvy, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_ZJOmBTKYCydkmcT5wCjawm-Xwt-m_qRT0X_p, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5tqdANB5_FA98PBxE6RCx_nAk9drWxBAeGgwL, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkB9j4wLpVqSog93sP0TH45GUPIvy5CUcbddpS, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM42ArLVBKM8zM6wxmdNNglTFnPt2wiDLODs1FN, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_Jfui91avHS9X1xPnA83uSXZOWO6G8R9VGSCn, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5dHHxYV5y6StJmyijRb4dcLBiWqqMMcwpFeiw, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI9ZZe4r_q8RlguCTvt6_2YsyXc8Ln-VkmVUYy, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1e3MZ_gewapi3F42nSbFDv6Gqhh1rOamn9mHM, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIgNivYic_6CVymaQEy6FY3dYG6GUqq_x-LJRJ, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcec5BPrH3-GVsSWRpQFKfA_gorJVmmy5owUpe, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-5bGzMqkrcmUFRKUBvOSDi6gQ1Ga7MXyYMYRy, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnuU12iIIIpIxrxu10_AE34H4utuYjFleL3GAD, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0HiiVO0isQPq6gyybDyEH8npZ8iFI8XkdnB2Z, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMldjPTPJ-SBLZ5DKe6YxceFGKnfXY0j6GzKDSC, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD0QX-mdN0Apk4YV9KaVehpLtHcPi-uv0O5gU9, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-HqAJgc5ISDCrXAilXfKSW3P9U7Wueq5BzaSz, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGMBW799tYzqcDo2feXL1jfzfNa192CgXdMxEr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbVeg6A1a8tuJhZTIussqfF4hUoJ6DixyG09WF, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXgspwJg85WHqT7jtfo5jvC7YdNblnvsK7g0gc, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrUveDZ46H5VBJdoQgatQlpTOFkrpZ79EE0SP-, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyPsdMd6R_EkrFuIF2FUraSgiD3PAqL_ZbE4AA, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlhZvGigMMuBxPWqxE2QYxDA2dGj5gElbpyds3, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgrEPKcIBBaPq-dyEHNQDhcOOhWFaRFyZF8Ke7, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2_7txKOtMTTfPL9nPkH2mVkRjkwhhDeEjYQBv, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTzoWwOnO0--o-xGs5TnDHPwLDyepAlvO8fpJ0, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0BTTqnQ_ALkuXkhkGeoqW-lV4E02UZF9hrh4K, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK5ddRhQC2yJPbvtfCCliDxlFBaJPHiVhdSFM8, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYvpzPpcrzef__-7mLXSjkra4cDdCJoEWYgAbr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpQJxvWtflXgHRtQvWw9cTTXWZM2ldAfFl7KI5, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlE2CGtqOd_jxIePRUfzed8mx4UKMhUJqZxYjg, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYAGOUxo1FWjf0D_zXbNUEq1l8pV_d0qDB7aKr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrqLcnYSv4EdZR3chccOVBdtB9rTdcon6VS8MW, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv8_dlAm7Uv82TJLO5cjMN56uoQN8pGrNgT1Wn, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkfbhR8VQLz7ZpTWN3Ob2Id65dq-6kM0JgRPtr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcq8OGRI_f7tML56FB_pwhp8byQnF8XUHA20m_, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVMfBrokfSpRqybHoQALMptVJXyvD0yRXrZwx4, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFQ8dUBpUDiQULwfNLZp_DWQcgGZHF0VjxEcuO, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6ydWQLm564TQs16KtwCX5FUlkaLIryKtXOZKo, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6c-ubbDPj5-0Vs9CBFV2r_2bLUmR2XC_1OqxO, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbZ_RFFMi6TpwbAmJpJoG0nfP6wtIOJ2g7d0KX, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7gkzEKi1lnWIPlWmkazXEI_sflNTK2H7s-tX4, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOPpCp_rqA0zKhVuSm8kg3JA-47COI81NT326-","4.4","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2Nk9yX2FREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID66Or_aQ%7CCgwIhfSdigYQ0KHtqgE%7C?hl=en","","5","#40 follow my Michelin Stars Marathon reviews on Googlemaps list On top of the world!

A bistro associated with the adjacent Michelin-starred Tour D’Argent (currently closed for renovations), we enjoyed delicious dishes and great service at this special place. To start our meal, we had the Duck Foie Gras with Red Port, Cherry Chutney and Hibiscus. It was outstanding. Rich and flavorful. The cherry chutney was the perfect accompaniment to the wonderful foie gras. Our main courses were the Pork Belly with Shiitake Mushrooms and Ginger Carrot Mousseline, and the Duck Confit with Sardalaise Potatoes. The pork belly paired with the mushrooms and ginger carrots was so good! An odd combination, definitely, but the ginger carrot mousseline was just amazing. Boyfriend said the duck was the best he’s had in Paris, and he had a lot of duck dinners! Moist and tender, with a rich sauce. We paired our meal with a nice bottle of Beaujolais. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly, checking on us frequently. There are outdoor tables across a busy street overlooking the Seine, and waiters would run back and forth, dodging traffic, to cater to guests seated there. It was windy when we visited, so we decided to sit on their indoor patio and enjoy the views from there. This was a wonderful “au revoir” to Paris.

The restaurant has long catered to an American clientale. It happens the I'm American. I spend alot of time in France. About 7 years ago someone recommended., La Rotisserie to us. We were thrilled-amazing rotisserie Lamb or Duck, carved in sections at our table . Roasted potatoes as well. Always delicious, without fail. Tonight, I arrived at the restaurant-it was a Monday night, and it was crowded;. But that's how this place rolls. I perused the menu, which seemed very different . They no longer offered the rotisserie lamb/duck for which they were ""famous"". The menu was abbreviated, with overpriced fare advertised. And no more rotisserie lamb or duck. Instead, I could have a ""lamb stew"". Though it didn't appeal to me at all, I ordered it. After a middling green salad starter (not on the menu, but the waiter ""graciously"" offered to order it for me""), out came the 'stew"". Ugh. Chunks of grilled, hard, grisly lamb, a few carrots.

The restaurant has long catered to an American clientale. It happens the I'm American. I spend alot of time in France. About 7 years ago someone recommended., La Rotisserie to us. We were thrilled-amazing rotisserie Lamb or Duck, carved in sections at our table . Roasted potatoes as well. Always delicious, without fail. Tonight, I arrived at the restaurant-it was a Monday night, and it was crowded;. But that's how this place rolls. I perused the menu, which seemed very different . They no longer offered the rotisserie lamb/duck for which they were ""famous"". The menu was abbreviated, with overpriced fare advertised. And no more rotisserie lamb or duck. Instead, I could have a ""lamb stew"". Though it didn't appeal to me at all, I ordered it. After a middling green salad starter (not on the menu, but the waiter ""graciously"" offered to order it for me""), out came the 'stew"". Ugh. Chunks of grilled, hard, grisly lamb, a few carrots. I could barely chew through the disgusting ""lamb"" chunks. The ""sauce"" was gross. I was beyond appalled. I can't believe that this restaruant=which until last year was delicious-hard sunk t this level. Never again Hoards of ""Amurricans"" might think it's ""authentic"" and great.

The staff is expertly attentive, and the food was exquisitely crafted! For those reviewers who would highlight the 'loss' of 2 of its Michelin stars - I would state that I personally experienced no lapse of service or quality of food whatsoever - it truly felt as good as they come. At times in Paris, restaurants can have the view, but lack the execution - not at La Tour D'Argent! The execution is flawless. The wine list, which is deep enough for the greatest of connoisseurs, is also approachable. Sure - there are gems in the wine list reaching into the most exclusive of pricing realms, but there are also accessible options for the special occasion splurge for those that generally would not eat at such a high-end restaurant. My wife and I, on a 7-year anniversary trip - enjoyed reaching a little bit deeper to experience La Tour D'Argent and were not disappointed. It will easily be remembered as the best meal, I've ever had in my life, affected only minimally by the epic location, and the gorgeous environment. (Dress code detailed note: I thought it prudent to make a note, because I know many reading these reviews are seeking it - La Tour D'Argent should be noted that for dinner service, formal attire makes the most sense - Coat + Tie for men, equivalent dressy attire for women). Lunch service may have slightly more exception, but remember - they are putting out the best in red-carpet treatment and service - return the gesture. Myself, I wore a blue suit coat, full button down white dress shirt, dress shoes, and extremely dark denim - I attempted modern-chic informal business - and I did not feel out of place. Had I lacked the coat, I feel I would have felt out of place. Even at lunch, men should have coats at La Tour D'Argent - blazer or otherwise. My wife wore a chic sweater, and a darker denim pair of pants, paired with a perfect pair of heels. (Most other women of the restaurant had on smart dresses, sweaters, or blazers that also suited the restaurant well). I will not tell you that La Tour D'Argent will toss you over your outfit (outside of extremes such as torn denim, sneakers, athletic clothing, etc), but I can tell you, my description for our attire above had us comfortable at lunch, and I would guess it hits a minimum expectation. Dress up! It can be fun! Pack suits that travel well - wear your coat on the plane, fold it gently for transit - you can do it - and have a great time. Ok, I'll wrap this up.

If one takes into account the recent transformation of La Rotisserie D'Argent, it may be in the negative soon. Le Rotisserie Beaujolais was the name of this restaurant the family owned until Andre Delair went Disney recently. Note the tourist who give high marks. Note the lack of Parisienne reviews and judge for yourself. As an American who lives in Paris an was a steady customer who referred many to this establishement, I recently went to the new transformation of this restaurant and was horrified. While the meat was done well, better now realize you have to order for two-you could get for one before Ms. Delair sold out to tourists or profit.

It now has one. If one takes into account the recent transformation of La Rotisserie D'Argent, it may be in the negative soon. Le Rotisserie Beaujolais was the name of this restaurant the family owned until Andre Delair went Disney recently. Note the tourist who give high marks. Note the lack of Parisienne reviews and judge for yourself. As an American who lives in Paris an was a steady customer who referred many to this establishement, I recently went to the new transformation of this restaurant and was horrified. While the meat was done well, better now realize you have to order for two-you could get for one before Ms. Delair sold out to tourists or profit.

Ambiente impeccabile, vista magnifica, cucina eccellente. La stella Michelin di cui gode, non è in grado di aggiungere nulla ad un posto del genere. È uno dei pochissimi ristoranti che si può ritenere al di sopra del giudizio della Guida Michelin.. non si può valutare la storia. La Tour d'Argent È Parigi. Quella eterna. Cantina infinita, con vini esclusivamente francesi (ad eccezione di svariati tipi di Porto) di grande livello, a prezzi non proprio convenienti (ma l'ambiente ha un suo prezzo e, inoltre, il ricarico eccessivo sui vini è pratica comune dei grandi ristoranti di Parigi).

Impeccable setting, magnificent view, excellent cuisine. The Michelin star it enjoys is unable to add anything to a place like this. It is one of the very few restaurants that can be considered above the judgment of the Michelin Guide... you cannot evaluate history. The Tour d'Argent IS Paris. The eternal one. Infinite cellar, with exclusively French wines (with the exception of various types of Port) of a high standard, at prices that are not exactly convenient (but the environment has its price and, furthermore, excessive mark-ups on wines are common practice in large restaurants in Paris). An experience that should be done at least once in a lifetime, if you can afford the prices (starting from €350/400 per person).","0","2781","Stefano Seganti","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103221059124245220479?hl=en","103221059124245220479","179","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXci5cnZsKKkJ_f0KDRzp1m7oy-fgsBBq6aWbuixUn0tCKqelf1","2024-05-28 00:00:00","0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:08:40.079886+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

Miła restauracyjka w pobliżu Sekwany. Jeszcze nigdy w życiu nie obsługiwało mnie w restauracji tak wielu ludzi. Chyba za każdą czynność jest tu odpowiedzialny kto inny. Ale to nie przytłaczało, odbywało się bardzo dyskretnie. Tradycyjne potrawy kuchni francuskiej, ale nie takie jak z tą kuchnią kojarzą się nam, Polakom. Z przystawek polecam Foie Gras, przepyszne. Ale uwaga na coś, co nam polecono jako specjalność zakładu. Były to jajka z majonezem, podane na pokrojonych w kostkę ziemniakach. Majonez oczywiście boski, ale z racji powszechności tych składników w polskiej kuchni można poczuć lekki zawód 😉 Dania główne bardzo smaczne. Pierwszy raz jadłam nerki cielęce. Sos do nich był po prostu genialny. Poza tym kaczka i wieprzowina (tłuste mięso, chyba boczek?, ale bardzo smaczne).

Very positive impressions. Nice restaurant near the Seine. I have never been served by so many people in a restaurant in my life. I guess someone else is responsible for every activity here. But it wasn't overwhelming, it was done very discreetly. Traditional French dishes, but not the ones we, Poles, associate with this cuisine. As for appetizers, I recommend Foie Gras, delicious. But watch out for something that was recommended to us as the house's specialty. They were eggs with mayonnaise, served on diced potatoes. The mayonnaise is, of course, divine, but due to the commonness of these ingredients in Polish cuisine, you may feel a bit disappointed 😉 The main courses are very tasty. I ate veal kidneys for the first time. The sauce for them was simply brilliant. Also duck and pork (fatty meat, probably bacon?, but very tasty).

When I first visited this 400-year-old Silver Tower restaurant, I was really shocked when I saw the photos and autographs of presidents and heads of state hanging on the walls, so I had more expectations for this restaurant. After finishing the meal, I silently made a wish that if I come back to Paris, I will definitely come here again because I have always missed the blood duck. It's a pity that I forgot to confirm the blood duck order with the restaurant this time, but the service is top-notch as always, and every dish is like a work of art. It's stunningly beautiful. In terms of taste, the blood duck seems to be better when I go there for the first time. One or two Although the color of the dish is beautiful, the taste is not something I appreciate. A very unforgettable experience, and of course the bill price is also very unforgettable (almost 1,000 euros). If you want to sit in the restaurant with the best view (panoramic view of Notre Dame de Paris), remember to make a reservation six months in advance and pay a deposit.

Bref, le personnel comprend la situation et notre frustration et est donc aux petits soins pour nous faire oublier ces désagréments et pour que l'on passe une bonne soirée (6 coupes de champagne, 1 entrée à partager et 1 dessert offert, ce n'est tout de même pas rien). Au final, les plats sont délicieux (le canard reste une référence, le saumon n'est pas en reste). Et pourtant, au moment du départ, l'expérience la plus inoubliable restera sans aucun doute la proposition de prendre un dernier verre sur le tout nouveau toit-terrasse du restaurant la Tour d'argent (situé juste à coté), profitant ainsi d'une vue encore plus impressionnante et magique sur Paris qu'escomptée initialement. Une mention très spéciale à Wallid et à toute son équipe pour leur attention de tous les instants, leur service irréprochable et leur constante bonne humeur tout au long de la soirée.

In short, the staff understands the situation and our frustration and is therefore very attentive to make us forget these inconveniences and so that we can have a good evening (6 glasses of champagne, 1 starter to share and 1 dessert offered, that's not all. is still not nothing). In the end, the dishes are delicious (the duck remains a reference, the salmon is not left out). And yet, at the time of departure, the most unforgettable experience will undoubtedly be the offer to have a last drink on the brand new roof terrace of the Tour d'Argent restaurant (located right next door), thus taking advantage of an even more impressive and magical view of Paris than initially expected.

This was my second trip to Paris, but I had higher expectations because it was my honeymoon.  The most embarrassing and disappointing thing was that before my visit, I had not received even a single word that La tour d’argent was closed for renovation and could not be used.  When I arrived at the reservation time, I was informed that the restaurant was under construction and that only La rotisserie d’argent next door was available.  As this was the restaurant I was most looking forward to during my honeymoon, it was difficult to express my embarrassment at that moment in words.  I thought about not only the restaurant's traditional food but also its proud wine list, so the night before I thought countless times about what menu I would eat and what wine would go well with it, but I felt like that happiness was taken away right before my eyes.  Moreover, my wife willingly came here with me even though she was having a hard time with morning sickness, and I felt really sorry.  Thank you for turning my trip to Paris into a nightmare, and I will never forget you.","13","2781","이똘찬","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106036433327168856739?hl=en","106036433327168856739","2","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJShur4zKZh6xieowYttxaiLx3RENAe0kFB7HtRkMWlKN9V-w",,"0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:09:07.718177+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

En apéritif, on nous sert des rillettes de porc maison. C’est très très bon. Mention spéciale pour l'œuf mayo champion du monde (9€) ! La cuisson de l'œuf est nickel, la mayonnaise bien assaisonnée se tient parfaitement. L'œuf est posé sur un socle de pomme de terre qui ajoute une texture supplémentaire à l’entrée. Les plats sont généreux, appétissants et canailles, le tout à un prix correct. La saucisse de chez Conquet (21€) nous a conquis. On goûte aussi le pigeonneau (42€), une grande première. C’est une jolie découverte, où le muscovado adoucit la viande et fait le lien avec les carottes. Pour accompagner le repas, une bonne tradition bien cuite et un pain aux fruits qui viennent de chez @leboulangerdelatour. Vraiment la porte à côté. On a tous opté pour le dessert du jour, le millefeuille vanille & cacahuètes (10€) ! Bien garni d’une jolie crème pâtissière, la pâte est croustillante, le mélange cacahuète-caramel rappelle le goût des chouchous. Régressif. Un joli repas du dimanche dans une brasserie traditionnelle chaleureuse, avec des plats de qualité et un service sobre et efficace.","Google","ChIJg4octORx5kcRijmhQTSm1Fs","La Rôtisserie d'Argent","2 years ago","2022-04-19 07:17:14.467666+00","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-oDWq4WgoicGdlnXGMCgKaWJKKZt733i0Y66P, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5Pu9T8LeFFYWYDotTVquC5q5D2iow2RMtKalS, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFPhESsAKvHVPZkFkddz_eMky-FdoDYsom4qUa, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4LFVqeEOF0xSPFTvw9AMFpOJF7BdNBqZYqoke, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvRC1VKpiXjgCIIe-tP4i4WM3gwwemUVtmHcXG, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_InPx6vf6Mp7JczacQ4rUaMwyco93XAxOtjLj, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2NxdWIssYrTjGwvSiiIt9qUzPMv5cfwup1CkP, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6OiNrujGfQwDMOpvm1il4DyeXOaAuB5p0CqjY, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQN2ZefhnqTOthLLjTsj6IfP3qi5Us8XD0hS2p","4.4","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyaHF1UWVnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC2hquQeg%7CCgsI_cP5kgYQuKHWew%7C?hl=en","","5","The setting is nice, in the spirit of a traditional brasserie with gingham tablecloths at the table. As an aperitif, we are served homemade pork rillettes. It's very very good.  Special mention for the world champion egg mayo (€9)! The cooking of the egg is perfect, the well-seasoned mayonnaise holds together perfectly. The egg is placed on a potato base which adds additional texture to the starter.  The dishes are generous, appetizing and cheeky, all at a fair price. The sausage from Conquet (€21) won us over. We also taste the squab (€42), a great first. It’s a nice discovery, where the muscovado softens the meat and creates a link with the carrots.  To accompany the meal, a good, well-cooked tradition and a fruit bread from @leboulangerdelatour. Really next door.  We all opted for the dessert of the day, the vanilla & peanut millefeuille (€10)! Well garnished with a pretty pastry cream, the dough is crispy, the peanut-caramel mixture recalls the taste of chouchou. Regressive.  A lovely Sunday meal in a warm, traditional brasserie, with quality dishes and simple, efficient service.","8","2781","Flavien Vaneson","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107028764633371340360?hl=en","107028764633371340360","318","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUtvkUluD-04t8soa-NU2cfNP31FWlBkgt8pmd6rQwQVGMhBF5Wdg","2022-03-28 00:00:00","0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:09:16.315514+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

Neanmoins attention aux sommeliers (Ils etaient deux presents) dont le niveau est en dessous de la moyenne : Ils ne savent meme pas reconnaitre un vin bouchonné et n'ont aucune connaissance dans les vins vieux.

Ma deuxième bouteille, un bordeaux 1981 suivant le chassagne montrachet 1976 etait malheureusement bouchonnée ! et ils ont refusé de la changer... c'est incroyable pour une table qui revendique une telle position de prestige.

However, pay attention to the sommeliers (there were two present) whose level is below average: They do not even know how to recognize a corked wine and have no knowledge of old wines. I come to this place for another reason than the duck: it's the only restaurant in Paris that offers old vintage wines at reasonable prices! My second bottle, a 1981 Bordeaux following the 1976 Chassagne Montrachet, was unfortunately corked! and they refused to change it... it's incredible for a table that claims such a prestigious position. (I am a wine professional in Bordeaux, wine merchant family since 1910) Otherwise the dishes were excellent, it was my third visit and I have never been disappointed by the dishes. Be careful of one small thing though for those who want to choose with knowledge of prices: there is no price indication on the menu or on the three menus offered!... Prices are only indicated on the wall at the entrance on the 1st floor on the right as you enter.","6","2781","sudre nicolas","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111509382480844652506?hl=en","111509382480844652506","154","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX7b1cmxdI7UpKq0NKbFesdRYZUcbuxKyMAgHdvrw_ScyE6r_RkSw",,"0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:09:32.812139+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

Els preus dels vins ens van obligar a fer una elecció molt discreta, però la vam gaudir igualment (demi bouteille de champagne rosat Deutz); no hi fa res, som de poc beure i en vam tenir suficient. L'experiència és un conjunt de sensacions molt intenses i en aquest indret tot acompanya: la gruixuda moqueta de llana, la coberteria Christofle, la taula de formatges, l'uniforme dels cambrers, els gustos, les olors i, evidentment, les vistes sobre l'Île de la Cité.

The service is very friendly, and I am delighted with the suit jacket deposit for all the gentlemen. It would be nice to add pants and a tie. It was a little hot, but I was told that it was forbidden to take off the jacket (suit, wool, given the season). Which meant that I had to interrupt my meal there.

Considera-se essa idade de 400 anos em função da existência de uma correspondente taverna no ""Quai de la Tournelle"", que teria sido frequentada pelo Rei Henrique IV de França, o qual aí tomou conhecimento do uso do garfo. Também aí esteve o Duque e Cardeal de Richelieu quando se serviu de uma novidade - o café. Suas mais conhecidas especialidades são aquelas com base no Pato. São os patos prensados, dos quais o mais famoso é o Caneton Tour d'Argent, criado em 1890 por Méchenet, em Rouen. O ""Tour d'Argent"" tem sua própria granja onde cria seus patos. Os jantares com o Caneton recebem um ""cartão"" com um número sequencial. Em 2001 quando lá estive, estavam próximos de um milhão. O restaurante tem uma famosa adega com mais de 500 mil garrafas de vinho, com um custo de muitos milhões de euros, a qual é guardada 24 horas por dia, 7 dias por semana. A sala de jantar proporciona uma excelente visão do Rio Sena e da Notre Dame de Paris. Vale muito a pena conferir!","Google","ChIJg4octORx5kcRijmhQTSm1Fs","La Rôtisserie d'Argent","4 years ago","2019-02-21 00:30:08.857543+00","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNB4z_2liu6jelETIPCbZCS6KLlsEXwGsaOSiZy, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ44LRdCghOxNft3leXcRON393_tJHxxZynRdB","4.4","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvNmV5REx3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICo6eyDLw%7CCgwIs6iF8QUQwM-XqwE%7C?hl=en","","5","La Tour d'Argent (The Silver Tower) is a restaurant in Paris whose owners claim (without documentation) to have existed since 1582. This age is considered to be 400 years old due to the existence of a corresponding tavern on the ""Quai de la Tournelle"" , which would have been frequented by King Henry IV of France, who learned about the use of the fork there. The Duke and Cardinal de Richelieu were also there when he helped himself to something new - coffee.  Its best-known specialties are those based on duck. These are pressed ducks, the most famous of which is the Caneton Tour d'Argent, created in 1890 by Méchenet, in Rouen. The ""Tour d'Argent"" has its own farm where it raises its ducks. Dinners with Caneton receive a ""card"" with a sequential number. In 2001 when I was there, they were close to a million. The restaurant has a famous wine cellar with more than 500 thousand bottles of wine, costing many millions of euros, which is guarded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The dining room provides an excellent view of the River Seine and Notre Dame de Paris. Very worth checking out!","3","2781","ANDRÉ CURVELLO","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108148919118129443218?hl=en","108148919118129443218","395","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW77BzsmiL7Klyupl340HHxJwmhk9FRcHIxvNTUA6xliPDyuCqf4g","2019-10-28 00:00:00","0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:10:13.57645+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

Pour finir, évitez à tout prix le tartare sous peine de vous réveiller avec une intoxication alimentaire en souvenir de la veille !

The server in question, although pleasant and smiling, shows a cruel lack of experience/skills which does not fit well with the prestige of the address. Among the most notable oversights are the drinks/aperitif menu, the request for meat cooking and the wine service.  I recommend blocking out an entire evening to dine at this place because the service is extremely slow (20 minutes to serve foie gras..).  Finally, avoid tartare at all costs otherwise you will wake up with food poisoning from the day before!

The waiters came to us 4 times asking what wine had we ordered and in the end had none.. The main courses were good but nothing surprised us taste-wise. We also asked to be placed on a table which was apparently reserved but which they then offered to other customers...

Vient l'entrée, après seulement une demi-heure d'attente, temps nécessaire à la découpe laser de quelques tranches de tomates sur lesquelles on a déposé une burrata. Un plat de gala que je réalise pour quatre euros chez moi, et encore. Ici, c'est un peu plus corsé, pas le plat, l'addition. Puis les plats principaux, servis 45 minutes après l'entrée, histoire d'être sûr que la digestion des tomates a bien commencé. Quelle tristesse. Un morceau de poitrine de porc, sec comme tout, une purée, le tout froid, l'assiette ayant dû être oubliée sur le bord d'un comptoir.

Taken mid August. To begin with, waiters in gala dress, on a summer evening, with questionable elegance (shirt masked by halos of faded, yellowed perspiration, an astonishing appetizer). Comes the starter, after only half an hour of waiting, time needed to laser cut a few slices of tomatoes on which we placed a burrata. A gala dish that I make for four euros at home, and more. Here, it's a little more robust, not the dish, the bill. Then the main courses, served 45 minutes after the starter, just to be sure that the digestion of the tomatoes has started well. How sad. A piece of pork belly, dry as anything, a puree, all cold, the plate must have been forgotten on the edge of a counter. To console ourselves, we ordered ice cream, which arrived half melted, the flavors served not being those ordered. In short, a small fortune for a forgettable evening.","0","2781","leon guillaume","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118253526074861028649?hl=en","118253526074861028649","16","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK7NIwlIKlX1dLCMLJ1NPviF0NDDeKgkL50T2kG4XTsQg1Y2g","2023-09-28 00:00:00","0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:10:57.208776+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

Tout d’abord l’ambiance : la terrasse sur le pont est une merveille avec le couché du soleil sur les monument de Paris incroyable . Ensuite le service : une équipe de saisonnier très sympa , un peut raide mais vraiment très bien . Pour ce qui est de la cuisine : La ont vas toucher à ce qui fâche ! J’ai déjà mangé dans cette institution plusieurs fois en 30 ans et à chaque fois ce fut un régal sauf ce soir la ! 1- pour cause de grippe Aviaire pas de canards ( spécialité de la maison) juste le demi poulet rôti qui arrivas avec la purée très bonne mai froide et juste avec l’aile et la cuise sans le blanc n’y le soliles . La cuisson basic alors qu’en général elle est parfaite . Le filet de bœuf (49€) juste avec une demi sucrine posée sur l’assiette et sans jus de cuisson de la viande, nous avant demandé des frite avec qui nous ont étais facturée 7€ . Et pour ce qui ai du bare ( la pêche du jour ) très bon sauf que la purée de patates douce étais froide . 2- Les entrées, pour les quenelles , elles sont arrivée froide. le foie gras (34€) une tranche fine perdu dans une assiette énorme se poudrée de beaucoup trop de piment d’Espelette . Je comprend qu’au mois d’août ce soir des équipe restreinte mais là il y avais à peine 6 tables d’occupee et pour le prix 310€ à 4 je pense qu’ont est en droit d’attendre une meilleur cuisine . Merci à l’équipe et à l’ambiance pour avoir rattrapé cet échecs . M.

First of all, the atmosphere: the terrace on the bridge is a marvel with the incredible sunset over the monuments of Paris. Then the service: a very friendly seasonal team, a little stiff but really very good. As for the kitchen: We're going to touch on what's annoying! I have already eaten at this institution several times over 30 years and each time it was a treat except this evening! 1- due to bird flu no ducks (house specialty) just the half roasted chicken which arrived with the mash, very good but cold and just with the wing and the cooking without the white and the sun. Basic cooking when in general it is perfect. The beef fillet (49€) just with half a sucrine placed on the plate and without any cooking juices from the meat, we asked for fries with which we were charged 7€. And for what I had (the catch of the day) very good except that the mashed sweet potatoes were cold. 2- The starters, for the quenelles, they arrived cold. the foie gras (€34), a thin slice lost in a huge plate, powdered with too much Espelette pepper.  I understand that in August this evening there were limited staff but there were barely 6 tables occupied and for the price of €310 for 4 I think we have the right to expect better cuisine.  Thanks to the team and the atmosphere for making up for this failure.

Accueillis par des jets de pierres,on nous a installés a 3 sur la meme chaise. Ils n'avaient plus de table de disponible et nous ont posé la nappe sur les genoux de Jean-Jacques,assis sur le dessus. Aucun menu n'a été présenté. Le serveur nous a donc récité les 374 plats un a un. Fastidieux,surtout que les deux autres commençaient a peser lourd sur mes cuisses endolories par les 7.985 marches qui mènent a la salle du restaurant. En buvant notre apéritif,nous avons eu la surprise d'apprendre que cet établissement touille et réchauffe son champagne avant de le servir,juste pour embêter le monde. . A 100.000 dollars la bouteille,ça fait mal au postérieur. Leur tartine de beurre manque de pain,leurs huitres au chocolat manquent de moutarde et leur toilettes a la Turque sont équipées de murs en verre et d'amplificateurs sonores. Si vous voulez une ambiance relax,ne cherchez pas plus loin. Le personnel ne parle que Chitmi et laisse son savoir vivre au vestiaire. . Le chef fume en cuisinant nu ,le serveur se récure le nez en prenant votre commande,le sommelier vous conseille de boire de l'eau du robinet parce que ""le rouquin maison est cradoc"" et le maitre d'hôtel,qui a la tonsure du prince William, n'a pas coupé ses dreadlocks depuis 1986. Les plats vous sont catapultés depuis la cuisine sous prétexte que ""les assiettes chaudes , ça brule les mains"". Cependant,ils visent super bien. Pas une miette sur la nappe. Pas une goutte par terre. Pas une tache sur nos chemises. Il faut leur laisser au moins ça: leur balistaire est un véritable sniper. Tout le temps du repas,le maitre d'hôtel vous tape derrière la tete en vous priant de vous magner parce qu'il ""n'a pas que ça a faire de sa soirée qu'a regarder des gros péquenots de province macher la bouche ouverte"". Soit,c'est louable. Mais de là à enfoncer la tete de ma femme dans son assiette brulante , 3 secondes après l’ avoir servie , en lui criant très fort : ""Allez ,la grosse, dépêche toi!!Mange, la grosse,mange!!""... Je ne pense pas que c'etait nécessaire. Pour le dessert,heureusement qu'un client bienveillant nous a conseillé d'éviter la mousse au chocolat du patron...

Absolutely perfect!! In every way!!! Even the gogues. Greeted by stones being thrown, 3 of us were seated on the same chair. They no longer had a table available and placed the tablecloth on Jean-Jacques' knees, sitting on top. No menu was presented. The waiter recited the 374 dishes to us one by one. Tedious, especially since the other two were starting to weigh heavily on my sore thighs from the 7,985 steps that lead to the restaurant room. While drinking our aperitif, we were surprised to learn that this establishment stirs and warms its champagne before serving it, just to annoy everyone. . At $100,000 a bottle, it's a pain in the butt. Their butter toast lacks bread, their chocolate oysters lack mustard and their Turkish toilets are equipped with glass walls and sound amplifiers. If you want a relaxed atmosphere, look no further. The staff only speaks Chitmi and lets their knowledge live in the locker room. . The chef smokes while cooking naked, the waiter scrubs his nose while taking your order, the sommelier advises you to drink tap water because ""the house redhead is dirty"" and the maître d', who has tonsure of Prince William, has not cut his dreadlocks since 1986. The dishes are catapulted to you from the kitchen under the pretext that ""hot plates burn your hands"". However, they aim really well. Not a crumb on the tablecloth. Not a drop on the ground. Not a stain on our shirts. We must leave them at least this: their ballistaire is a real sniper. Throughout the meal, the butler slaps you on the back of the head, begging you to indulge because he ""doesn't just have to spend his evening watching fat provincial hillbillies chewing their mouths opened"". Either way, it’s commendable. But from there to pushing my wife's head into her hot plate, 3 seconds after having served it, shouting at her very loudly: ""Come on, fat girl, hurry up!! Eat, fat girl, eat!!"".. I don't think it was necessary. For dessert, fortunately a kind customer advised us to avoid the owner's chocolate mousse... Anyway, I'm going back tomorrow to celebrate my 13th birthday with friends, as the McDonald's is already booked.

Les points positifs : très bon accueil et bon service. Le canard et le poisson du menu étaient excellents. La vue évidemment est superbe, même si nous n'avons pas bénéficié de la meilleure table en terme de placement. La décoration est également très jolie. Les points négatifs selon nous : le prix de l'assiette de fromage !! À 30€ l'assiette, avec des portions très petites et par notre expérience de nombreux restaurants étoilés avant celui-ci, nous avons trouvé ce prix excessif. Le serveur s'est trompé à la fin du repas en me servant de l'eau gazeuse au lieu d'eau plate. D'ailleurs, nous ne savons pas d'où provenait l'eau, quelle marque c'était, car nous n'avons vu aucune bouteille, l'eau était directement servie en carafe (le client devrait voir la provenance du produit qu'il reçoit). Le foie gras avait l'air délicieux mais nous avons trouvé le goût curieux et n'avons pas aimé. Enfin, la première bouteille de vin que nous avons prise (du blanc) avait un goût très particulier, fade, vraisemblablement un goût pas normal ! La sommelière a répondu à nos questions mais n'a pas proposé de goûter le vin. Visiblement le personnel suspectait quelque chose d'anormal, car on ne nous a pas proposé d'emporter le reste de la bouteille non consommé, contrairement à la bouteille de vin rouge que nous avons remportée.

The positive points: very warm welcome and good service. The duck and fish on the menu were excellent. The view is obviously superb, even if we did not benefit from the best table in terms of placement. The decoration is also very pretty. The negative points in our opinion: the price of the cheese plate!! At €30 a plate, with very small portions and from our experience of many starred restaurants before this one, we found this price excessive. The waiter made a mistake at the end of the meal by serving me sparkling water instead of still water. Besides, we do not know where the water came from, what brand it was, because we did not see any bottle, the water was served directly in a carafe (the customer should see the origin of the product that he receives). The foie gras looked delicious but we found the taste odd and didn't like it. Finally, the first bottle of wine we had (white) had a very particular, bland taste, probably not a normal taste!

When I arrived at the reservation time, I was informed that the restaurant was under construction and that only La rotisserie d’argent next door was available.

I thought about not only the restaurant's traditional food but also its proud wine list, so the night before I thought countless times about what menu I would eat and what wine would go well with it, but I felt like that happiness was taken away right before my eyes.

Pour suivre, on nous a servi des haricots verts surgelés (garantis frais par le serveur mais congelés pour sûr) et une sauce béarnaise façon mayonnaise arrangée n'ayant rien à voir avec une authentique sauce béarnaise, qui devrait être une émulsion chaude réalisée minute. Ne cherchez pas un jus de viande cuisiné maison avec le poulet, il s'agit tout simplement de la sauce s'écoulant naturellement de la broche. Un coup d'oeil prolongé sur la cuisine ouverte a expliqué bien des choses: ambiance très moyenne au sein de la brigade et des gestes ""étranges"" plutôt dérangeants ont été observés (poulets ôtés de la broche après le service puis mis au frais – resservis le lendemain? –, poissons oubliés dans un coin de la cuisine à leur sortie du four avant d'être envoyés en salle, chef qui se mouche et oublie de se laver les mains, etc.). L'addition a quant à elle était à la hauteur de la déception. Un note positive: la viande était de belle qualité et bien cuite.

The “world champions” mayonnaise eggs are quite ordinary (homemade mayonnaise too mustardy, cooking of the eggs needs to be reviewed). To follow, we were served frozen green beans (guaranteed fresh by the server but frozen for sure) and an arranged mayonnaise-style béarnaise sauce having nothing to do with an authentic béarnaise sauce, which should be a hot emulsion made on the spot. Don't look for a homemade gravy with the chicken, it's simply the sauce flowing naturally from the spit. A prolonged glance at the open kitchen explained many things: very average atmosphere within the brigade and rather disturbing ""strange"" gestures were observed (chickens removed from the spit after service then refrigerated - reserved the next day? –, fish forgotten in a corner of the kitchen when they came out of the oven before being sent to the dining room, chef blowing his nose and forgetting to wash his hands, etc.). The bill was as disappointing as it was. A positive note: the meat was of good quality and well cooked. To conclude: I regret my coming to this establishment, which did not make me want to try the gourmet restaurant when it reopened (although it was one of my dreams). Damage. I invite the curious to move on and look at Parisian establishments focusing more on the quality and freshness of the products than on their reputation.","1","2781","Mathias Kerninon","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116340588507530670004?hl=en","116340588507530670004","3","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKT7UNw2gJltQsapRY2D7A6Q2tE1ZKpSLDLol9XMuzpek9JYlE","2022-05-28 00:00:00","0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:11:59.009335+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

I requested JCB Plaza Lounge Paris to make a reservation two days before my scheduled date, but I was able to make a reservation without any problems, probably because it was lunch. Advance information from guide books and other sources said there was a dress code, but since the visit was suddenly decided, I had not brought a jacket from Japan. On the day of the event, I went there in a Y-shirt, slacks, and leather shoes feeling anxious, but they didn't say anything to me and there were no problems. I didn't have to be so nervous about what to wear for lunch. After I was shown to my seat, I looked at the menu, but it was pretty boring in French, so I told them in English that I wanted to eat duck, and they chose the duck lunch course. I was a little nervous at first as I was not used to high-end stores, but when I told him that I didn't understand anything, he was very kind and thorough in explaining things to me. The food was really delicious, and I was able to order several types of wine by the glass, so I enjoyed it. I forget the exact price, but I think the lunch course cost about 70 euros. A glass of wine was about 15-30 euros. Also, there is a wine shop with the same name as the restaurant across the road from the restaurant entrance. The glass door at the entrance has an electric lock, so if you look inside the store and knock, it will open. A very gentle and smiling elderly gentleman will be there to assist you, and he is very kind and speaks English. The restaurant sells wines selected by the restaurant, and many of them have labels with the Tour d'Argent name on them. I found the prices here to be very reasonable, often between 15 and 30 euros. I think if you buy the same or equivalent wine in Japan, it will cost about three times as much. When you purchase wine here, no matter how much wine you buy, they will put it in the shop's original paper box and put it in a nice carrying bag.

Nous avons pris une coupe de Champagne, un verre de vin rouge et un menu basique. LE MENU de la semaine avait été réduit à un choix on ne peut plus simple qui n'offrait pas de choix tant pis si vous n'aimez pas. Nous avons apprécié l'entrée trés cuisinée (base oeuf poché et morilles ,mais trés moyennement aimé le plat du jour imposé (2 filets de caneton grillé avec cacao) et en légumes des oignons frits (donc trés peu de légumes en rapport de la viande servie). En dessert une tarte au chocolat pas trés originale. Je m'étais imaginé prendre un repas exceptionnel et malheureusement je vais vite l'oublier. C'est trés dommage même pour le personnel nombreux guettant votre moindre demande. Merci de tenir compte de ce message et ne pas proposer des menus sans choix de ce type. Je ne reviendrai pas.","Google","ChIJg4octORx5kcRijmhQTSm1Fs","La Rôtisserie d'Argent","2 years ago","2022-04-29 21:37:44.603291+00","","4.4","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMycDR2TWJBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC2p4vMbA%7CCgwIqLWxkwYQ-PrVnwI%7C?hl=en","","2","This April 28 at noon, my children treated us to a meal in this prestigious establishment.

We had a glass of Champagne, a glass of red wine and a basic menu. THE MENU of the week had been reduced to a very simple choice which offered no choice too bad if you don't like it. We appreciated the very cooked starter (poached egg and morel mushroom base, but very moderately liked the imposed dish of the day (2 grilled duckling fillets with cocoa) and fried onions in vegetables (so very few vegetables compared to the meat served).

Buy yourself a sandwich and have dinner at home, it will be much better. What horror, I will never again set foot and my palate in this establishment...

Nous l'avons donc choisi pour y célébrer avec mon épouse un anniversaire important. Ce fût l'apothéose d'une très belle journée qui avait commencé par la visite de la nouvelle Samaritaine et qui s'était poursuivi à la Fondation Vuitton pour la collection Morozov... Bien sûr, le lieu est exceptionnel. Notre table n'était pas celle qui donnait la meilleure vue sur Notre-Dame de Paris, mais la ""déception"" a très vite été contrebalancée par l'accueil professionnel, attentif et chaleureux que nous avons reçu. La Tour d'Argent est une vraiment grande maison qui a gardé en le modernisant la tradition du luxe non ostentatoire à la française ! Merci à André Terrail de s'intéresser à sa clientèle et de prendre le temps de venir se présenter en échangeant avec ses hôtes. Merci au service de réservation de transmettre les messages particuliers (nous étions heureux de souffler une bougie, et mon épouse ravie de repartir avec un petit cadeau). Pour les amateurs d'annuaires, ils seront comblés par le livre de cave, et pour ceux qui ne veulent pas plonger dedans (ce qui est mon cas), le sommelier sera leur conseiller des vins au verre, ce qui est somme toute beaucoup plus simple quand on veut élargir la palette de ses dégustations. Mon épouse fait une allergie compliquée au foie gras : nous n'avons donc pas pu prendre le menu (pour deux) autour du canard. C'est une excellente raison pour revenir dès que possible à trois ! Mais rassurez-vous, pour ceux qui sont dans ce cas, la carte offre de multiples autres possibilités (dont du canard numéroté - le nôtre 1 175 343) pré-découpé à la table ! Remerciements renouvelés à toute l'équipe de la salle et toute la brigade pour une excellente soirée qui restera un très grand souvenir En résumé, un moment magique, un peu hors du temps.","Google","ChIJg4octORx5kcRijmhQTSm1Fs","La Rôtisserie d'Argent","2 years ago","2021-11-21 08:03:55.346484+00","","4.4","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHblAyUVl3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDGnP2QYw%7CCgwI6_rnjAYQoNqbpQE%7C?hl=en","","5","La Tour d'Argent was one of the last prestigious restaurants in Paris that we didn't know about. We therefore chose it to celebrate an important birthday with my wife. It was the apotheosis of a very beautiful day which began with the visit of the new Samaritan and which continued at the Vuitton Foundation for the Morozov collection... Of course, the place is exceptional. Our table was not the one with the best view of Notre-Dame de Paris, but the ""disappointment"" was quickly offset by the professional, attentive and warm welcome we received. La Tour d'Argent is a truly great house which has kept the tradition of non-ostentatious French luxury while modernizing it! Thank you to André Terrail for taking an interest in his customers and taking the time to introduce himself by interacting with his hosts. Thank you to the reservation service for transmitting the special messages (we were happy to blow out a candle, and my wife delighted to leave with a small gift). For lovers of directories, they will be delighted by the cellar book, and for those who do not want to delve into it (which is my case), the sommelier will advise them on wines by the glass, which is all in all much more simple when you want to broaden the range of your tastings. My wife has a complicated allergy to foie gras: we were therefore unable to take the menu (for two) based on duck. This is an excellent reason to come back as soon as possible to three! But rest assured, for those in this case, the menu offers multiple other possibilities (including numbered duck - ours 1,175,343) pre-cut at the table! Renewed thanks to the entire room team and the entire brigade for an excellent evening which will remain a great memory In summary, a magical moment, a little out of time.","0","2781","Martial de Calbiac","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102867107068440127139?hl=en","102867107068440127139","3","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUq6ZsixNMt5koGBZ__V5RiHMrkz0zRjLbg0AuAFgO2ZhdqL9yG","2021-11-28 00:00:00","0x0:0x5bd4a63441a1398a","2024-07-28 15:12:40.815263+00","https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Tour+d'Argent/@48.8499542,2.3524796,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47e671e4b41c8a83:0x5bd4a63441a1398a!8m2!3d48.8499369!4d2.3547128","most_relevant","English (United States)"

Pendant ce temps, je ronge mon frein, ne pouvant qu'à peine lire avec une cataracte et 2 bougies d'éclairage. Quand elle revient 1 heure plus tard, les pieds meurtris, je lui dis que la fête est à l'eau, qu'il faut aller ailleurs le plus vite possible mais que je ne laisserai pas 400 € à ces gens là, que l'on va en prendre pour ce montant et se sauver. Enfin arrive un cerveau qui a tout compris et qui nous permet de partir en affirmant que ma CB ne sera pas débitée.

Meanwhile, I'm champing at the bit, barely able to read with a cataract and 2 light candles. When she comes back 1 hour later, her feet bruised, I tell her that the party is over, that we have to go elsewhere as quickly as possible but that I will not leave €400 to these people, that the we're going to take this amount and run away. Finally a brain arrives who has understood everything and who allows us to leave, affirming that my credit card will not be debited.

If you reserve duck 48 hours in advance, you can enjoy a more special dish. You can meet them. The wine pairing is also fantastic. Good service, friendly cooking explanation It was great for a wedding anniversary dinner. But the price is a little expensive. The two of us drank champagne wine with a multi-course meal. It was well over 1000 euros.
